# Campus Cup Campaign

## Project Overview

This project aims to reduce single-use cup consumption on university campuses through a social-norms-based intervention. The intervention leverages principles of behavioral science to encourage students to bring reusable cups when purchasing coffee or other beverages.

## Intervention Strategy

The prototype intervention consists of two main components:

1. **Poster Campaign**: Eye-catching posters placed in high-traffic areas near campus coffee shops, conveying social norms messages about reusable cup usage.

2. **Social Media Campaign**: A series of posts across campus social media channels to reinforce the message and create a sense of community around sustainable behaviors.

## Theoretical Foundation

The intervention is based on the concept of **social norms**, which are the unwritten rules about what is considered acceptable behavior within a group. Specifically, we aim to leverage:
- **Descriptive Norms**: Communicating what most people actually do (e.g., "9 out of 10 students bring a reusable cup at least once a week").
- **Injunctive Norms**: Communicating what people should do (e.g., "Bring a reusable cup to help reduce waste").

Research indicates that combining both types of norms is more effective than using injunctive norms alone.

## Next Steps

- Finalize poster and social media copy.
- Conduct pilot testing with focus groups.
- Implement A/B testing to measure impact on cup usage.
